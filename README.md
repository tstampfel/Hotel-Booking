# Introduction

Hotel-Booking is an example app where I demostrate my skill with React, Redux, TypeScript, Apollo, TypeGraphl, Nodejs, Postgresql and Redis. Feel free to fork or clone it.

# Getting Started

Add connection strings to config folder files
Run "npm i" both on root and in client folder
Run "npm run dev" from root
